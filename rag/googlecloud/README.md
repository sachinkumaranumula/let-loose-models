# Google Cloud

Google cloud asks you to rethink why you need a rag and as common sense take the below approach to get to wins

They maintain their [repo of notebooks](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/search) here on variants.

I strongly suggest out of the box unless needed, since cost to answers is low and get the managed service handle it. If you have strict compliance and isolated tenancy of your data then move to the right with a RAG workflow or Agentic. They have well defined API's for each step of the workflow as below
